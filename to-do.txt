after completing the last question in the set, the "next" button should be replaced with a "review" button.
when clicked, it should show you a score of how many you got right, and wrong, and offers to try the wrong ones only
for that, it will store the answers that you're getting correct, and ones youre getting wrong, includong their count
then it changes the questions array to just have the wrong ones.
then, when pressing on any of the sets buttons, it should stop doing the wrong questions, and load the questions from that set
